## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to test locally
4. Create the Database:

- https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart-sqlite

  At this point, you have a Prisma schema but no database yet. Run the following command in your terminal to create the SQLite database and the User and Post tables represented by your models in the schema.

Run:
`npm run seed` to test and seed the database with a test podcast channel

or, directly... Run a migration to create your database tables with Prisma Migrate with:
`npx prisma migrate dev --name init` to create the database and make it available to the application

This command did three things:

- It created a new SQL migration file for this migration in the prisma/migrations directory.
- It executed the SQL migration file against the database.
- It ran prisma generate under the hood (which installed the @prisma/client package and generated a tailored Prisma Client API based on your models).

Because the SQLite database file didn't exist before, the command also created it inside the prisma directory with the name dev.db as defined via the environment variable in the .env file.

Congratulations, you now have your database and tables ready. Let's go and learn how you can send some queries to read and write data!

## Deploy

### Deploy on Docker

0. Add `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` with DB location for prisma client

1. Add Dockerfile.dev, add `output: "standalone"` to `next.config.mjs`

2. Build the Docker image
   `docker build -t nextjs-app-dev -f Dockerfile.dev .`

3. Run the container
   `docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-app-dev`

4. Maybe you want to seed the database: Seed the database using the script in `prisma/seed.ts`
   `docker exec -it nextjs-app-dev npm run seed`

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Getting Started with Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
