        We are an educational project that aims to teach and create young
        entrepreneurs through practice by creating real projects, discovering
        and covering real needs, on the way to creating a startup.

        The objective of the site is to offer a service to be used personally,
        non-profit, which facilitates being able to listen to audiovisual
        content at any time, ordered by your own interests. You don't always
        have the opportunity and conditions to consume with attention to be able
        to "watch", and "listening" is enough, or sometimes, better.
