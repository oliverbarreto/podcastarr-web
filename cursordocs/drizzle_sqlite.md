# Get Started with Drizzle and SQLite

This guide assumes familiarity with:

- dotenv - package for managing environment variables - read here
- tsx - package for running TypeScript files - read here
- libsql - a fork of SQLite optimized for low query latency, making it suitable for global applications - read here

Drizzle has native support for SQLite connections with the libsql and better-sqlite3 drivers.
We will use libsql for this get started example. But if you want to find more ways to connect to SQLite check our SQLite Connection page

## Basic file structure

This is the basic file structure of the project. In the src/db directory, we have table definition in schema.ts. In drizzle folder there are sql migration file and snapshots.

ðŸ“¦ <project root>
â”œ ðŸ“‚ drizzle
â”œ ðŸ“‚ src
â”‚ â”œ ðŸ“‚ db
â”‚ â”‚ â”” ðŸ“œ schema.ts
â”‚ â”” ðŸ“œ index.ts
â”œ ðŸ“œ .env
â”œ ðŸ“œ drizzle.config.ts
â”œ ðŸ“œ package.json
â”” ðŸ“œ tsconfig.json

## Step 1 - Install required packages

```bash
npm i drizzle-orm @libsql/client dotenv
npm i -D drizzle-kit tsx
```

## Step 2 - Setup connection variables

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your database connection variable:

```bash
DB_FILE_NAME=
```

> IMPORTANT
> For example, if you want to create an SQLite database file in the root of your project for testing purposes, you need to use file: before the actual filename, as this is the format required by LibSQL, like this:
> `DB_FILE_NAME=file:local.db`

You can check the LibSQL docs for more info.

## Step 3 - Connect Drizzle ORM to the database

Create a index.ts file in the src directory and initialize the connection:

```ts
import "dotenv/config"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql"
const db = drizzle(process.env.DB_FILE_NAME!)
```

If you need to provide your existing driver:

```ts
import "dotenv/config"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql"
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client"
const client = createClient({ url: process.env.DB_FILE_NAME! })
const db = drizzle({ client })
```

## Step 4 - Create a table

Create a schema.ts file in the src/db directory and declare your table:
`src/db/schema.ts`

```ts
import { int, sqliteTable, text } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core"
export const usersTable = sqliteTable("users_table", {
  id: int().primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true }),
  name: text().notNull(),
  age: int().notNull(),
  email: text().notNull().unique()
})
```

## Step 5 - Setup Drizzle config file

Drizzle config - a configuration file that is used by Drizzle Kit and contains all the information about your database connection, migration folder and schema files.
Create a drizzle.config.ts file in the root of your project and add the following content:
`drizzle.config.ts`

```ts
import "dotenv/config"
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit"
export default defineConfig({
  out: "./drizzle",
  schema: "./src/db/schema.ts",
  dialect: "sqlite",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DB_FILE_NAME!
  }
})
```

## Step 6 - Applying changes to the database

You can directly apply changes to your database using the drizzle-kit push command. This is a convenient method for quickly testing new schema designs or modifications in a local development environment, allowing for rapid iterations without the need to manage migration files:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Read more about the push command in documentation.

### TIPS

Alternatively, you can generate migrations using the drizzle-kit generate command and then apply them using the drizzle-kit migrate command:

```bash
Generate migrations:
npx drizzle-kit generate

Apply migrations:
npx drizzle-kit migrate

Read more about migration process in documentation.
```

## Step 7 - Seed and Query the database

Letâ€™s update the src/index.ts file with queries to create, read, update, and delete users
`src/index.ts`

```ts
import "dotenv/config"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/libsql"
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm"
import { usersTable } from "./db/schema"

const db = drizzle(process.env.DB_FILE_NAME!)

async function main() {
  const user: typeof usersTable.$inferInsert = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    email: "john@example.com"
  }

  await db.insert(usersTable).values(user)
  console.log("New user created!")

  const users = await db.select().from(usersTable)
  console.log("Getting all users from the database: ", users)
  /*
  const users: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email: string;
  }[]
  */

  await db
    .update(usersTable)
    .set({
      age: 31
    })
    .where(eq(usersTable.email, user.email))
  console.log("User info updated!")

  await db.delete(usersTable).where(eq(usersTable.email, user.email))
  console.log("User deleted!")
}

main()
```

## Step 8 - Run index.ts file

To run any TypeScript files, you have several options, but letâ€™s stick with one: using tsx
Youâ€™ve already installed tsx, so we can run our queries now
Run `index.ts` script

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

### TIPS

We suggest using bun to run TypeScript files. With bun, such scripts can be executed without issues or additional settings, regardless of whether your project is configured with CommonJS (CJS), ECMAScript Modules (ESM), or any other module format. To run a script with bun, use the following command:

```bash
bun src/index.ts
```

If you donâ€™t have bun installed, check the Bun installation docs
